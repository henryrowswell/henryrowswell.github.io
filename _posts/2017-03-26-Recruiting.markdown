Post updates and progress on here.

### March 27, 2017
* **BoxBot**
   - Completed 1hr HackerRank assessment today
   - First question (out of 8) took me about half an hour so at first I was freaking out thinking how could you possibly complete 8 questions like this in under an hour?! But it turned out \#2 and \#3 were easier coding questions, and \#4-\#8 were just multiple choice.
   - So in the end, I managed to complete all the questions and pass all the test cases! It was still pretty crazy though, I found and fixed a bug in \#1 with less than 2 mins to spare.
   - Just waiting to hear back now.

* **Volta**
  - Talked to lead engineer on the phone today about the data applications team intern role. I think it went alright!
  - Found out Volta is still pretty small, <100 people and only ~2 engineers at the moment, but looking to build up their engineering teams.
  - Based in SF (in a warehouse), Potrero hill area. Found out some shared interests with the lead engineer, like rock climbing at Dogpatch Boulder and they also participated in LeMons!

* **SkyRyse**
  - Technical phone screen this Friday
  - Kind of surprised I passed their 20min Hackerrank assessment, it was all on C++ pointers and addresses and I kind of learned it along the way

* **Luminate**
  - Had a Google Hangouts technical interview last Thursday, waiting to hear back
  - That interview was insightful but a little strange. Interviewer was an engineer on the cloud infrastructures team, and didn't show up for our original time of 2:00pm. I emailed them around 2:20 about it, and he just said "Sorry, I was occupied with something" and set up for 2:30. Then, this is how the interview went:
    - Noticed I set CoderPad to python 2, asked if I know python 3, so I said sure. Then asked me if I can list 3 differences between python 2 and python 3! So I said uhhh main thing I noticed is in python 2 you can do `print xyz` but in python 3 you have to do `print(xyz)`.
    - Then he asks if I know about decorators, to which I say yea vaguely but I'm pretty rusty on them. And then he's like "ok cool then can you implement it for me". I mean, I practically JUST told him I don't know how to do that. Anyway, with some guidance from him and some guessing from me, I got through it. He did a similar thing during this question where I mentioned I know it's possible to write a lambda here on one line instead of defining an empty `def` function, but I don't remember the syntax for lambdas, and he immediately says "ok can you make it a lambda then". So I repeated that I don't remember the syntax and he let me google it and I figured it out.
    - And then his second question was a math question! It was actually a question I remember doing in CS70, but it was just a probability question, not really practical or applicable on a daily basis. All it did was test me if I could remember Bayes' Theorem, which I couldn't. Basically, you have a medical test for diabetes that gives false positive 1/1000 times. Given that 1/10,000 people actually have diabetes, and that you receive a positive diagnosis, what is the probability you actually have diabetes?
      - So I knew it's basically just probability of a given b (hence Bayes'), but I couldn't remember the formula for it and it took a long time for him to walk through the derivation of it.
      - The only good thing was that at one point I pointed out something he had overlooked, which was that we also needed to know how often the machine gives a false negative (at least, according to the formula we were using). Which he initially disagreed with, but then thought about it and realized I was right.
  - I bought a webcam just for that interview! (well and future interviews)
  - Anyway, I feel like I learned from it at least, and it wasn't too bad, I mean I showed I could figure things out so maybe they'll get back to me, or maybe not.

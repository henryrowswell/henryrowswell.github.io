This was an idea I had a few weeks ago. I just thought it would be a cool project to learn from and show off afterwards. It turns out, unsurprisingly, that it's actually quite a bit more difficult than I thought initially, so this will definitely be an ongoing post.

The idea is simple: to be able to input a Sudoku puzzle and use an algorithm to quickly solve it. Initially I wanted to make a mobile app but I figured I would start by implementing it on PC first to avoid the trouble of learning mobile at first.

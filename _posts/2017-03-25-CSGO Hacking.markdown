I've always wondered how to hack / cheat video games, I think that's why modding Minecraft was really interesting to me (back in high school). This year, as I started playing CSGO more I got more and more curious about how people hack in this game. Hackers are pretty prevalent in CSGO, and I wondered if they were able to somehow decompile the code in order to modify it since that's how I used to modify Minecraft.

Anyway whenever I was curious I would do a quick Google search to see what I could find but the first couple times I wasn't able to really find anything (I guess my searches were bad). But then a few days ago, my curiosity peaked again and I stumbled upon some video tutorials.

I learned about a tool called Cheat Engine, which can scan memory in order to find what addresses are used to store variables within the game. In simple single player games, you could just modify the value in memory at that address, and your health for example would change in game!

The tutorials I found were actually really good and walked me through creating three hacks in CSGO so far: a bunny hop script, a trigger bot, and a wall hack. None of them are actually usable in a real online game because Valve's Anti-Cheat (VAC) system can supposedly detect them really easily and ban your account.
